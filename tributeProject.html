      <p>This is the greatest and best website in the world: <strong>Tribute</strong>.</p>
      <p>
        Long time ago, me and my brother here, we was hitchhikin' down a long and lonesome road. Suddenly, 
        there appeared a developer in the middle . . . of the road. And he said, "Write
        the best website in the world, or I'll fire you both."
      </p>
      <p>
        Well, we looked at each other and said, "Okay."
        And we wrote the first thing that came into our heads--just so happened to be, the best site in the world; it was
        the best site in the world. Look into our code and it's easy to see: one and one make two; two and one make three; it's 
        binary. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Needless to say, the developer was stunned. A whip-crack with his fountain pen, and the ink had run. He asked us, 
        "Be you programmers?" 
      </p>
      <p> And we said, "Yay, we are code brothers. Code oooooooooooooon!"</p>
      <p>
        This is not the greatest site in the world--no, this is just a tribute. Couldn't remember the greatest site in the world.
        No, this is just a tribute.

        And the peculiar thing is this, my friends, the site we wrote on that fateful night, it didn't actually look anything
        like this site.
